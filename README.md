# Underwater Image Enhancement - an accessible solution  <img src=https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55969597/236365759-2092212e-83d1-4c99-947a-cff43e7c481e.png width=150 align='right'>

An accessible solution for enhancing underwater images by color correcting, dehazing, denoising and detecting objects. 

## 💡Introduction 

- Underwater photography is an exciting and rapidly growing field that offers a unique view into the beauty and diversity of marine life. 
- Capturing high-quality underwater images can be challenging due to the adverse lighting conditions, water turbulence, and other factors. 
- Overall, this project aims to provide a comprehensive solution for enhancing the quality of underwater images and making them more visually appealing for a wide range of applications.

## 🧠Motivation 

- Address the challenges of underwater imaging. 
- Marine biology, oceanography, and underwater exploration. 
- Challenges: poor visibility, color distortion, and noise
- The ultimate goal of this project is to provide researchers, scientists, and underwater explorers with a tool that can improve the quality of underwater imaging, allowing them to better understand and explore the underwater world.

## 📲What it does?

- Inputs the image URL of the image to be enhanced
- Color corrects the image
- Dehazes the color corrected image
- Denoises the dehazed image
- Detects objects in the enhanced image

## ⛔️Challenges we ran into 

- Availability of underwater images with ground truth data for 
- Collecting large amounts of high-quality labeled data can be a time-consuming and expensive task, especially for underwater
- Another challenge is the computational complexity of the algorithms used in the project
- Laptops and GPU computational power


## 🚀Conclusions and Future Scope
- Effectively removes noise
- Enhances the contrast of the underwater images
- The method can still further be optimised as can be seen from the low PSNR value obtained.
- The experimental results show that the proposed method can be applied to various underwater imaging applications, such as underwater surveillance, marine biology, and oceanography without using high computational energy and in a short amount of time.
